# X-ray-Echo-Romeo-Oscar
Xero - My Keylogger that implements hybrid cryptosystem to protect logs, and is platform independent.
Still uses Text-book cryptography . 

# Requirements :
Pycrypto , Pyaes , Pynput libraries 

# Future : 
1. changing from pycrypto to pycryptodome for both RSA And AES implementation and not using pyaes(just)
2. transmitting logs via Sockets , Google Forms , Emails. 
3. upgrade to standard implementations of cryptography(not textbook but deployable system)
